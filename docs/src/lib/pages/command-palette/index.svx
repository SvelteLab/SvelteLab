# Command Palette

To keep the UI clean and simple, SvelteLab has most goodies hidden inside the Command Palette.

To open it, use shortcut <kbd>CMD</kbd>(or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>)+<kbd>K</kbd>. You can also use <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.

## File Palette

You can also use the File Palette to search for files. Use the shortcut <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or you can remove the `>` from inside the Command Palette input.
