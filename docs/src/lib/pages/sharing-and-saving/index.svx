# Sharing and Saving Projects

## Share Code Snapshot

Using this method, a snapshot of the current file tree gets compressed into a very long URL that will open a new SvelteLab App with that snapshot.
The contents of this link will not change when you update and save your project.
New unsaved projects can only be shared via code snapshot.

## Share Project

Saved projects can be shared via Project ID. The contents of this link will stay in sync with any updates you save to your project.

## Open project from GitHub

Projects can also be opened with github with the following url format: `https://sveltelab.dev/github.com/username/repo`

<OpenWithButton/>
