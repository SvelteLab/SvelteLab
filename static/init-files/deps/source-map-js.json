See #159.\n\n* Added a benchmark for parsing and generating source maps.\n\n## 0.3.0\n\n* Change the default direction that searching for positions fuzzes when there is\n  not an exact match. See #154.\n\n* Support for environments using json2.js for JSON serialization. See #156.\n\n## 0.2.0\n\n* Support for consuming \"indexed\" source maps which do not have any remote\n  sections. See pull request #127. This introduces a minor backwards\n  incompatibility if you are monkey patching `SourceMapConsumer.prototype`\n  methods.\n\n## 0.1.43\n\n* Performance improvements for `SourceMapGenerator` and `SourceNode`.

See issue #131.\n\n## 0.1.38\n\n* Fix a bug where finding relative paths from an empty path were creating\n  absolute paths. See issue #129.\n\n## 0.1.37\n\n* Fix a bug where if the source root was an empty string, relative source paths\n  would turn into absolute source paths. Issue #124.\n\n## 0.1.36\n\n* Allow the `names` mapping property to be an empty string. Issue #121.\n\n## 0.1.35\n\n* A third optional parameter was added to `SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap`\n  to specify a path that relative sources in the second parameter should be\n  relative to. Issue #105.\n\n* If no file property is given to a `SourceMapGenerator`, then the resulting\n  source map will no longer have a `null` file property. The property will\n  simply not exist.

Some part of it was rewritten to Rust and WASM and API became async.\n\nIt's still a major block for many libraries like PostCSS or Sass for example because they need to migrate the whole API to the async way. This is the reason why 0.6.1 has 2x more downloads than 0.7.3 while it's faster several times.\n\n![Downloads count](media/downloads.png)\n\nMore important that WASM version has some optimizations in JS code too. This is why [community asked to create branch for 0.6 version](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/324) and port these optimizations but, sadly, the answer was «no». A bit later I discovered [the issue](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/370) created by [Ben Rothman (@benthemonkey)](https://github.com/benthemonkey) with no response at all.\n\n[Roman Dvornov (@lahmatiy)](https://github.com/lahmatiy) wrote a [serveral posts](https://t.me/gorshochekvarit/76) (russian, only, sorry) about source-map library in his own Telegram channel. He mentioned the article [«Maybe you don't need Rust and WASM to speed up your JS»](https://mrale.ph/blog/2018/02/03/maybe-you-dont-need-rust-to-speed-up-your-js.html) written by [Vyacheslav Egorov (@mraleph)](https://github.com/mraleph). This article contains optimizations and hacks that lead to almost the same performance compare to WASM implementation.\n\nI decided to fork the original source-map and port these optimizations from the article and several others PR from the original source-map.\n\n---------\n\nThis is a library to generate and consume the source map format\n[described here][format].\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n\n## Use with Node\n\n    $ npm install source-map-js\n\n<!-- ## Use on the Web\n\n    <script src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/source-map/master/dist/source-map.min.js\" defer></script> -->\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<!-- `npm run toc` to regenerate the Table of Contents -->\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Examples](#examples)\n  -

The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.  Line numbers in\n  this library are 1-based (note that the underlying source map\n  specification uses 0-based line numbers -- this library handles the\n  translation).\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.  Column numbers\n  in this library are 0-based.\n\n* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest\n  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,\n  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.

The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.  The line number is\n  1-based.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.  The column\n  number is 0-based.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  The line\n  number is 1-based.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  The\n  column number is 0-based.\n\n```js\nconsumer.generatedPositionFor({ source: \"example.js\", line: 2, column: 10 })\n// { line: 1,\n//   column: 56 }\n```\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,\nand column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings\ncorresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line\nthat has any mappings.

The line number is\n  1-based.\n\n* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.  The\n  column number is 0-based.\n\nand an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  The line\n  number is 1-based.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.

The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\nIf the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is\nthrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned\ninstead.\n\n```js\nconsumer.sources\n// [ \"my-cool-lib.clj\" ]\n\nconsumer.sourceContentFor(\"my-cool-lib.clj\")\n// \"...\"\n\nconsumer.sourceContentFor(\"this is not in the source map\");\n// Error: \"this is not in the source map\" is not in the source map\n\nconsumer.sourceContentFor(\"this is not in the source map\", true);\n// null\n```\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional.

Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n```js\nconsumer.eachMapping(function (m) { console.log(m); })\n// ...\n// { source: 'illmatic.js',\n//   generatedLine: 1,\n//   generatedColumn: 0,\n//   originalLine: 1,\n//   originalColumn: 0,\n//   name: null }\n// { source: 'illmatic.js',\n//   generatedLine: 2,\n//   generatedColumn: 0,\n//   originalLine: 2,\n//   originalColumn: 0,\n//   name: null }\n// ...\n```\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as\n  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with\n  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when\n  running tests, if possible.\n\n```js\nvar generator = new sourceMap.SourceMapGenerator({\n  file: \"my-generated-javascript-file.js\",\n  sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/app/js/\"\n});\n```\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new `SourceMapGenerator` from an existing `SourceMapConsumer` instance.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n```js\nvar generator = sourceMap.SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(consumer);\n```\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n```js\ngenerator.addMapping({\n  source: \"module-one.scm\",\n  original: { line: 128, column: 0 },\n  generated: { line: 3, column: 456 }\n})\n```\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n```js\ngenerator.setSourceContent(\"module-one.scm\",\n                           fs.readFileSync(\"path/to/module-one.scm\"))\n```\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimum of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n```js\ngenerator.toString()\n// '{\"version\":3,\"sources\":[\"module-one.scm\"],\"names\":[],\"mappings\":\"...snip...\",\"file\":\"my-generated-javascript-file.js\",\"sourceRoot\":\"http://example.com/app/js/\"}'\n```\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn't associated with an original line.

[\n    \"tres\",\n    new SourceNode(5, 6, \"c.js\", \"quatro\")\n  ]\n]);\n\nnode.toString()\n// 'unodostresquatro'\n```\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n```js\nvar node = new SourceNode(1, 2, \"a.js\", [\n  new SourceNode(3, 4, \"b.js\", \"uno\"),\n
